# Mexico-Toy-Sales

The present study, derived from a Kaggle dataset, is about sales of a ficticious chain of toy stores, called "Maven Toys". This chain is supposedly based in Mexico.
Four csv-datasets were used in the analysis. The datasets are included in the repository in case of any individual wanting to corroborate the present srudy or perform different analysis.


In order to know the essential elements like profits per year or per month, SQL was used.
To reach the main objectives, it was necessary to implement joins across two or three tables. Moreover, essential operations like percentages were made whithin the join-query type.

In the future, a DAX-Power BI will confirm the results obtained by SQL and will be used to display the data through a dashboard.
